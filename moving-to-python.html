	<h2>My Journey to Python</h2>
	<p>Back in 1989, when I first entered graduate school, I knew a handful
of languages to some modest degree. For the sake of computations, I
knew Basic and Fortran. During that first year I was assigned a
project that required substantial programing (for my skill set at the
time). This project was almost complete with about an hour to go
before the deadline. Unfortunately, this was the days of floppy drives
(it was not a personally owned PC). I accidentally stepped on the
switch on a power strip and damaged the files beyond my capability to
recover them. With about an hour to go a fellow student, Jeff Umland-
now of JPL, suggested that perhaps I should heed his advice and use
Matlab. <em>The project would be simple</em> in Matlab according to him. There
was certainly no way I could complete the project in Fortran so with
him responding to my shouted out questions I started using Matlab, and
I finished with time to spare. That was the last time I started a
project using Fortran. Fortran has its place, but it has been clear to
me ever since that for most problems facing me, time of development
far exceeded time of program execution. So, the cost of using an
interpreted language was well worth the price in time when development
time was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this can build some bad habits that I am still working
through. Nevertheless, I continued to learn <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> and later wrote the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vtoolbox.com">Engineering Vibration Toolbox</a> in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>. I immediately noticed that
in Matlab each function is the name of a file, an once that file is in
the path, you can have a clash of names. Over the years many of my
programs have been broken because of the shared name space, which
continues to grow. Names such as <em>addpath</em>, <em>spectrum</em>, <em>plot3</em>,
etc. have been replace by Mathworks m-files. Further, when I
distribute a code, I have to be concerned about their
clashes. Fortunately I was savvy enough to effectively create my own
name space for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vtoolbox.com">Engineering Vibration Toolbox</a> to name each and
every file <strong>vtb#_#.m</strong>, hoping that my starting them with <em>vtb</em> they
would remain safe. That seems to have stood the test of time.</p>
<p>So, although the names stood the test of time, and I noticed many of
my programs for personal use did not. I've become further
disenfranchised by the lack of ability for me to truly own my own
codes. Without a Matlab license, until <em>Octave</em> came around, your
M-files were your own, but ot little value if you didn't continue to
pay the MathWorks. I appreciate the effort that they put into writing
Matlab, but I put time into my code as well, and I cannot afford to be
tied to them.</p>
<p>As you can guess, I later switched to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a>. Ironically, what I
liked the best about Octave initially was that it wasn't a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>
clone. As time has moved on, the author, John Eaton, has acquiesced to
public pleading and moved further and further towards <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>
compatibility[#]_.</p>
<p>I still like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a> and have great respect for the developer, but I
noticed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and that it seemed to really be taking programming to
another level. The add-on packages are extensive. The language isn't
designed to be purely for computation/data manipulation, but in many
respects, it's better, IMHO. Instead of rehashing, I'll redirect you to
the opinions of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html">Pyzo</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html">Hoyt Koepke</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://phillipmfeldman.org/Python/Advantages_of_Python_Over_Matlab.html">Phillip M. Feldman</a>. I
personally love the readability of the code. It just looks good, and
that prevents mistakes. I've attempted Object Oriented Programming in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> (reinvented it myself) for a purpose. After looking at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>,
I wish I never had. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>, and by analogy <a class="reference external" href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a>, are somewhat
limiting languages compared to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. They have served me well.
I will likely use them again in the future. However, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> has empowered
me to generate more capable code than I ever could in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> due to
Matlab's limitations.</p>
<p>Oh, and I made this website in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, using <a class="reference external" href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, and writing
the source files in <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">ReST</a>.</p>

Part of the fun I've had with Python is watching (and trying to participate in)
the rapid development of it's capabilities. I've packaged a couple minor things,
`array_to_latex`_ and `vibration_toolbox`_, and am working on the
`Vibration Testing Toolbox`_ or whatever I may name it. You can see I'm still
a bit Matlab_ fixated.  However, as I grow, I'm constantly discovering that my
Matlab_ fixation has caused my programming skills to atrophy. So, with my
`move to python`_ I'm also learning the Python ecosystem who the "players"
I need to watch are. Sometimes it's a person, sometimes it's a particular
website or blog of interest. Nevertheless, I'm listing them here so I can find
them, and maybe that will help you too. The best description of why a link/person is here is that I need to keep going back and looking/watching.



People
========

Over time I've noticed I keep going back to the same people for help/guidance. Some of them know me, or at least they've responded to my contacts. Others don't have a clue that I have found their work immensely helpful. They are in no specific order.

1. `Travis Oliphant`_: Scientific computing in Python wouldn't be the ecosystem it is without him.
2. `Jake VanderPlas`_: A number of great tidbits on high powered computing, plotting, and understanding the Python ecosystem.
3. `Lorena Barba`_: I also link to her github page below. I don't think she sleeps.
4. `Steven Silvester`_: Helped me a lot, and has a lot of neat tricks in his pages and packages. Super nice guy.
5. `Olga Botvinnik`_: Not blogging as much as she once did, but always good reading. Her blog helped me get started in `matplotlib`_. I do wish she had more time to write on Python as she excels in clean and clear explanation.
6. `Roshan Rush`_: A slew of great YouTube videos on things Python

Pages
=========

The following are pages I've found immensely useful.

1. `Scipy`_: Central to scientific computing in python
2. `CFD Python`_
3. `Conda Full Install`_: People just need to find this often enough


.. [#] Ironically, early on he expressed clear reluctance on my part
       to convert to the standards of the then substantially differing
       Octave help system. I think he missed when I came to agree with
       him about that and other things!

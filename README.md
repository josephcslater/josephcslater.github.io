Inside the Ivory Tower.

This is my blog... but not really. You want to go to [josephcslater.github.io](http://josephcslater.github.io) to read it. This is not the readable form. 

To make changes to this blog, I work in the source branch. From this I build and push to the master branch which serves everything- if it works and I remember (which I often don't!).

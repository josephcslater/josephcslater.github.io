Eventually we all get a figurative kick in the teeth, most of us more than once. Sometimes it's in sports, sometimes as a musician. It may be school, it may be work. Everyone seems to quickly encounter such in relationships, some more than others, but many simply don't show. While there is a plethora of inspirational quote to help us get back to our lives (It's not how you fall, it's how you stand up.), I find listening to the right song at the right time the way to do this. The following are songs that I've used to pick me back up. What I need, which is certainly different for others, is something with energy that has a sense of determination and inspires relentlessness and something with a lesson. It typically needs to speak to the actions I needs to take. They are never specific of course, but inspire *getting back on the horse*. The lyrics have to hold on their own. If I read them, would they provide what I need? The music must reflect what I need. The pairing is what makes them stand out.

Many are filled with clichés. Well, they are clichés because they've had staying power. Backed with music, the universal language, they can be powerful messages at just the right moment.

This is admittedly my biased list. There are many other inspirational songs that are touching and impressive. Queen's *The Show Must Go On* is perhaps the greatest, once the backstory is known. However, it doesn't move me to act. *Eye of the Tiger* is a common entry in this category... I'm not a Tiger. I just can't think the song is about me. It's a bit too abstract.

1. Right Now, Van Halen.
   This is classic rock, easy to listen to, and a fun song. Energizing and motivational
   Summary: Life is short. Sitting still won't help. Get up, keep going.
2. Falling, Staind.
   This is alternative rock. Not what one would consider fun. It's brooding. This is the song you should hear in your head when you awake after being knocked out in a fight. All you have is pain. You have no energy, you have no hope.
   Summary: Wallowing is self-destructive. When you wallow, you become your own problem. Faith in yourself is the only way out.
3. It's My Life, Bon Jovi.
   Similar to *Right Now*, it is a classic rock song that's fun to listen to and good for working out.
   Summary: Own your own life, make your own choices, and don't wait.
4. Rise Above This, Seether.
5. Prayer of the Refugee. Rise Against
6. It's Not My Time, 3 Doors Down



.. [1] The `Anaconda`_ distribution you install is completely open source. They constantly feed their software into the open source community, for free, and are unbelievably good citizens in the free software community. Keep in mind: the people doing this work need to eat. They've somehow managed to find a way to give away the product, even provide support for it, and get paid for yet a higher level of service. From my experience, they must flying in to your city, stopping by your MD's waiting room, and helping you code while you wait. I don't know what they do, but they do it, so I don't but this argument.
